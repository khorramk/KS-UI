building_blocks
 a simple building + nature syntax UI built using float and legacy css framework.

#grid_layout

   as in conventional framework this frameowrk uses 12 grid coloumn layout and 12 grid row layout.

   you just install it using the cdn then use containers such as package-wraper to combine all coloumns and rows.

   `<div class="package-wrap">
       <div class="flat-1 floor-1 bricks-right water"></div>
       <div class="flat-2 floor-2 bricks-right wood"></div>
    </div>
    `
    as you can see flat-1 is row and floor being the coloumn.
    bricks-right align the boxes to right and left if you cahnge it to left, left will be alinged.

    bgcolor:
     in this scenerio i have chosen nature theme so water being the color of the boxes.
