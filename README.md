# building_blocks
 a simple building + nature syntax UI built using float and legacy css framework.

## grid_layout

   as in conventional framework this frameowrk uses 12 grid coloumn layout and 12 grid row layout.

   you just install it using the cdn then use containers such as package-wraper to combine all coloumns and rows.

   `<div class="package-wrap">
       <div class="flat-1 floor-1 bricks-right water"></div>
       <div class="flat-2 floor-2 bricks-right wood"></div>
    </div>
    `
as you can see flat-1 is row and floor being the coloumn.
 bricks-right align the boxes to right and left if you cahnge it to left, left will be alinged.

class: flat-1 = one row
class: flat-2 = two row 
and the list goes on until 12 rows
just to make sure change the number after the flat

class: floor-1 = one colunm
class: floor-2 = two colunm
and the list goes on until 12 coloumn
make sure to change the number if you need to

aligning boxes right or left
just use `bricks-right` or `bricks-left`
